# Seating Notes

- A seat is uniquely identified by the combination of seat_section_id, seat_row_num, and a seat_num. For example: section ID 322, row 13, seat 4.

- A ticket represents a single seat for a single event.

- Tickets are (re)purchased and transferred in contiguous seat blocks. They do not span rows or sections.
  Ex. when first_seat_num = 6 and num_seats = 5, this block of seats covers 6-10 in their respective row/section.

- Transfers and resells could break ticket blocks apart over time (ex. The account owner of a 4-seat block could transfer or resell the last 2 seats).

# Table Definitions

- tm_ticket_exchange: This table captures ticket ownership changes over time (i.e. a ticket which is resold or transferred will have more than 1 row in this table). It contains data for all ticket block activity (original sales, re-sales, and transfers), including purchase ID, event ID, account ID, activity date, etc.

- tm_event: Contains data for all scheduled home games across the current and previous seasons.

- crm_contact: This table contains contact information about each customer. It also holds a Ticketmaster account ID which links the customer to their TM account.
